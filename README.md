# Virtual Zoo

## Overview
The Virtual Zoo is a console-based Java application that allows users to explore a virtual zoo featuring three animals: Tiger, Dolphin, and Penguin. Each animal has unique behaviors and characteristics that users can interact with through the command-line interface.

## Features
- **Three Animal Classes:** Includes Tiger, Dolphin, and Penguin, each with distinct behaviors.
- **Console-Based Interaction:** Users can input commands to interact with the animals.
- **Animal Sounds:** Each animal can make sounds unique to their species.
- **Behavior Simulation:** Different animals have different behaviors, such as swimming for Dolphins, roaring for Tigers, and waddling for Penguins.
